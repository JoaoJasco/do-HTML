    <h1>Getting started HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML <i>(HyperText Markup Language)</i>, is the backbone of web development. It is used to structure content on the web by organizing text, images, links, and other multimedia elements into a coherent format that can be displayed by web browsers. The benefits of HTML are vast; it is easy to learn, widely supported across different browsers and devices, and highly versatile. HTML provides a foundation for creating visually appealing and interactive web pages when combined with CSS and JavaScript. Its simplicity allows developers to quickly create and edit web content, making it an essential skill for anyone looking to build a presence on the web.
